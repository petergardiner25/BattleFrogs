### Initial inspiration:

A wave of little frogs attacks your castle. Your mouse is a catapult that shoots every couple of seconds automatically. That can be upgraded to different fun funny things and increase speed. Itâ€™s important to place your shots in the right places

You can upgrade your ground troops, archers, towers, walls etc that are more passive upgrades

The waves of frogs have different levels and as they get harder there are different types of enemies. Each enemy will be small pixel art so it can look like swarms. Some big boss enemies will be a normal sprite that will look big.

Pixel art everything for the level design.
